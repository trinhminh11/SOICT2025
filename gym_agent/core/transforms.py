        .. versionchanged:: 0.26

            The Step API was changed removing ``done`` in favor of ``terminated`` and ``truncated`` to make it clearer
            to users when the environment had terminated or truncated which is critical for reinforcement learning
            bootstrapping algorithms.

        Args:
            action (ActType): an action provided by the agent to update the environment state.

        Returns:
            observation (ObsType): An element of the environment's :attr:`observation_space` as the next observation due to the agent actions.
                An example is a numpy array containing the positions and velocities of the pole in CartPole.
            reward (SupportsFloat): The reward as a result of taking the action.
            terminated (bool): Whether the agent reaches the terminal state (as defined under the MDP of the task)
                which can be positive or negative. An example is reaching the goal state or moving into the lava from
                the Sutton and Barton, Gridworld. If true, the user needs to call :meth:`reset`.
            truncated (bool): Whether the truncation condition outside the scope of the MDP is satisfied.
                Typically, this is a timelimit, but could also be used to indicate an agent physically going out of bounds.
                Can be used to end the episode prematurely before a terminal state is reached.
                If true, the user needs to call :meth:`reset`.
            info (dict): Contains auxiliary diagnostic information (helpful for debugging, learning, and logging).
                This might, for instance, contain: metrics that describe the agent's performance state, variables that are
                hidden from observations, or individual reward terms that are combined to produce the total reward.
                In OpenAI Gym <v26, it contains "TimeLimit.truncated" to distinguish truncation and termination,
                however this is deprecated in favour of returning terminated and truncated variables.
            done (bool): (Deprecated) A boolean value for if the episode has ended, in which case further :meth:`step` calls will
                return undefined results. This was removed in OpenAI Gym v26 in favor of terminated and truncated attributes.
                A done signal may be emitted for different reasons: Maybe the task underlying the environment was solved successfully,
                a certain timelimit was exceeded, or the physics simulation has entered an invalid state.

        This method generates a new starting state often with some randomness to ensure that the agent explores the
        state space and learns a generalised policy about the environment. This randomness can be controlled
        with the ``seed`` parameter otherwise if the environment already has a random number generator and
        :meth:`reset` is called with ``seed=None``, the RNG is not reset.

        Therefore, :meth:`reset` should (in the typical use case) be called with a seed right after initialization and then never again.

        For Custom environments, the first line of :meth:`reset` should be ``super().reset(seed=seed)`` which implements
        the seeding correctly.

                a seed will be chosen from some source of entropy (e.g. timestamp or /dev/urandom).
                However, if the environment already has a PRNG and ``seed=None`` is passed, the PRNG will *not* be reset.
                If you pass an integer, the PRNG will be reset even if it already exists.
                Usually, you want to pass an integer *right after the environment has been initialized and then never again*.
